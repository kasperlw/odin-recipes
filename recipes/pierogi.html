<h3><bold>Description</bold></h3>
<p>Traditional Polish pierogi are popular dumplings filled with a variety of fillings. The dough encases the fillings, creating a distinctive half-moon shape. The pierogi can be boiled or fried and are often served with toppings like sour cream, saut√©ed onions, or fresh herbs. They hold a special place in Polish culinary heritage and family gatherings.</p>

<h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>

<ul>
    <h4><strong>FILLING:</strong></h4>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
    <li>7 potatoes, peeled and boiled</li>
    <li>400 grams of farmer's cheese</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of sour cream</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

</ul>

<ul>
    <h4><strong>DOUGH:</strong></h4>
    <li>8 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>

</ul>

<h4><strong>STEPS</strong></h4>

<ol>
    <li>Prepare filling: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and mushrooms in hot oil until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Pass potatoes and farmer's cheese separately through a food grinder or food processor; place both in a large bowl. Add onion-mushroom mixture, sour cream, salt, and pepper; mix until well combined and set filling aside.</li>
    <li>Make dough: Place flour on a clean work surface and form a well in the center. Crack eggs into the well. Add butter and a few tablespoons warm water. Mix with your hands, gradually adding more warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as you go. Knead until dough is soft and smooth, adding more flour to the work surface as needed.</li>
    <li>Roll out 1/4 of the dough to an 1/8-inch thickness. Use a glass or round cookie cutter to cut out circles, saving any excess dough for your next batch. Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and pinch edges together to seal. Cover pierogi with a clean dish towel and repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Cook pierogi in batches, about 20 at a time, in boiling water until they float to the surface, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a strainer to drain.</li>

</ol>

<h3><em>Smacznego!</em></h3>
